# Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. It includes preprocessing the MNIST dataset, dimensionality reduction, training models such as Regression and Neural Networks, and deploying a functionality to recognize digits on a screen board and Vocalize the recognized digits.

## Technologies Used
    - Python
    - Jupyter Notebook
    - Numpy, Pandas
    - TensorFlow, Keras
    - Matplotlib
    - OpenCV
    - pygame
    - pyttsx3
    
## Project Structure
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Includes normalization, reshaping, and visualization of the MNIST dataset.
  - **Dimensionality Reduction:** Used to reduce feature dimensions for better visualization.
  - **Model Training:** Implements Logistic Regression and Neural Networks for digit classification.
  - **Digit Recognition on Screen Board:** Utilizes OpenCV for real-time digit recognition on a screen board, with audio output.

## Features
  - **MNIST Dataset:** Preprocessed and used for training and testing.
  - **Model Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports are provided.
  - **Real-time Digit Recognition:** Ability to detect and audibly announce handwritten digits on a screen board.
